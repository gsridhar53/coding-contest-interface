1.	All the files have 644 permission, while the directories have 755 permissions

2.	The "Uploads" directory has 777 permission

3.	The testcases should not have an extra \n at the end of input. The line number should be same as the last input line. Same applies to output file as well.

4.	Steps to load the interface:
	First, run the init.sql from the "Database" folder
	Add Questions from the "Database/Sample Questions" folder
	Goto the interface and register as "admin"
	Submit the answers

5.	If the "first dump.sql" file is already present, then load the same. Both are same

6.	Make sure you have "db_connect.php" file. Without that file, the interface wont work
